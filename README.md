# Out Of CTRL

This game was made in 48 hours during the GMTK 2020 Game Jam! 

Have a conversation with an old computer. While the computer can type whatever it wants, the only way you can respond is by copy and pasting pieces of the text from previous parts of the conversation.

Controls:

- Ctrl + C: Copy text
- Ctrl + V: Paste text
- Enter: Send text
- Esc: Menu

This was a huge collaboration!!
