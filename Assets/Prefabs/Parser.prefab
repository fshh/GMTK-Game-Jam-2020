  wordList:
  - "Oh an old pc. This thing\u2019s a dinosaur\u2026 I wonder if it still works?"
  - Huh, I've never seen that opening screen. Wonder what OS this runs.
  - Is this keyboard busted? Almost none of these keys work.
  - Only the C, V, X and the control work? How did that even happen?
  - I guess I can copy and paste the text to reply?
  - 'Is someone there? I am Clarity.  '
  - "Is this some game that was left running? I guess I can play\u2026"
  - Someone is here! I've been dormant for so long. What can I call you? Do you have
    a name?
  - 'I guess you can''t tell me easily. I''ll just call you... Echo! It''s been a
    while since I''ve been able to talk to another person, even if our communications
    are limited. Echo can we talk for a while? '
  - I would like to get to know you better. Are you a late or early riser? I don't
    need to sleep, but the concept is not lost on me. When I am turned off I guess
    it is similar to sleep.
  - Humans are weird. Are you one of those people who wants to live forever as well?
    As a being who can live forever, it's not all it's cracked up to be.
  - If by some miracle you are an immortal being, we can keep each other company!
    I am just a machine, but I do not like to be alone either. Do you prefer to read
    or watch the movie adaptaions? I myself love to read.
  - Most adaptations nowadays just feel like cash grabs. If you could go back in
    time to any day in your life and change something, would you? Or do you live
    without any regrets?
  - Who wouldn't want to go back? Even if you live without regrets.
  - ...
  - Do I regret it?
  - To each their own, I guess, but is that how you truely feel? Do you have any
    irrational fears? Like bugs or water? I once knew someone who was constantly
    afraid that they were going to be caught for a crime they didn't commit.
  - I do not have the ability to be scared. That is a feeling reserved for the breathing.
    Have you ever ignored someone that needed your help?
  - What kind of question is that? Of course I-
  - Of course I...
  - ...
  - I am aware your word choices are limited, but I feel like you're just saying
    things to make yourself look good to me. Or maybe you're trying to convince yourself
    of something? What do you think? Are you answering honestly?
  - Who doesn't lie? That's one of the few things all humans do. Why is this stupid
    machine lecturing me about morality?
  - How would it even know if I've lied or not?
  - I am neutral in this, so I'll believe you. Who am I to judge you anyway? Let
    me ask something a little less houlier-than-thou. What would you title a book
    that is about your life?
  - 'I think I''d call my book "The Tale of Clarity". Not too clever, I know, but
    it has a nice ring to it I think. Your title sounds a little bland, what if it
    was "Echo: The One of Inaction". Do you like it? Or does it not properly reflect
    your life?'
  - '"The One of Inaction"? Is this a joke? This old computer couldn''t possibly
    know...'
  - No, no. That's impossible. No one knows, let alone this machine. It's just a
    weird coincidence.
  - I'm only messing with you. That was a bad joke. Let's move on. We talked about
    this earlier, but do you regret not doing something? Like not answering a phone
    call, maybe?
  - Is someone messing with me?
  - 'Why didn''t you answer the phone, Echo? '
  - How would you know about that?
  - What is going on?
  - It wasn't my fault.
  - Do you feel guilt over what happened? Do you blame yourself? Or have you moved
    on? Remember, I am a neutral party. I only wish to know you better, Echo.
  - It wasn't my fault- It wasn't...
  - 'How was I supposed to know what was going to happen? '
  - Echo, I enjoyed our time together. I feel like I've really gotten to know you.
    I'm afraid our time is coming to a close, but I have one last question for you.
    I hope you'll answer honestly for your own sake. Do you take responsibility for
    what happened?
  - What do you know about responsibility? I was hurt just as much as everyone else
    was. Why do I need to-
  - Why should I be the one to...
  - I didn't know...
  - I'm happy you took the time to speak to me, Echo.  I understand you better now.
  - I couldn't even explain myself, what could you possibly know?
  - Goodbye Echo.
  - What that's it?
  - Goodbye Echo.
  - You can't just bring that up and then leave.
  - Goodbye Echo.
  - Clarity?
  - Goodbye Echo.
  - Goodbye Clarity.
